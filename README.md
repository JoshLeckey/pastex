# Pastex
a simple pastebin type script. Uses php and a database  

#to connect to your database, open dbcon.php, and edit these lines with your information  

 $dbhost = "localhost";  <---- only change if you have an ip. most hosting providers use localhost  
 $dbuser = "yourusername"; <---- change with your username. could be your hosting username  
 $dbpass = "yourpassword"; <---- change with your password. could be your hosting password  
 $db = "pastx"; <--- change with your database name (case sensitive)  
 
 to make sure the database works, please import tables.sql so that correct tables are there
